     * ## Android
     *
     * On Android, this is a MAC address represented as a [String]. A [Peripheral] can be created
     * from this MAC address using the `Peripheral(String, PeripheralBuilderAction)` builder
     * function unless the peripheral makes "use of a Bluetooth Smart feature known as 'LE Privacy'"

     * On Apple, this is a unique identifier represented as a [Uuid]. A [Peripheral] can be created
     * from this identifier using the `Peripheral(Uuid, PeripheralBuilderAction)` builder function.

     * If `Peripheral(Uuid, PeripheralBuilderAction)` throws a [NoSuchElementException] then a scan
     * will be necessary to obtain an [Advertisement] for [Peripheral] creation.
     *
     * ## JavaScript
     *
     * On JavaScript, this is a unique identifier represented as a [String]. "Restoring" a
     * peripheral from this identifier is not yet supported in Kable (as JavaScript requires user to
     * [explicitly enable this feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Bluetooth/getDevices)).

     * a [discovered characteristic][DiscoveredCharacteristic] from [services] should be used instead.
     *
     * When using [characteristicOf], observations can be setup ([observe] can be called) prior to a
     * [connection][connect] being established. Once connected, the observation will automatically start emitting
     * changes. If connection is lost, [Flow] will remain active, once reconnected characteristic changes will begin
     * emitting again.
     *
     * If characteristic has a Client Characteristic Configuration descriptor (CCCD), then based on bits in the
     * [characteristic] properties, observe will be configured (CCCD will be written to) as **notification** or
     * **indication** (if [characteristic] supports both notifications and indications, then only **notification** is
     * used).
     *
     * While the peripheral is fully connected, failures related to observations are propagated via the returned
     * [observe] [Flow], for example, if the specified [characteristic] is invalid or cannot be found then returned
     * [Flow] terminates with a [NoSuchElementException]. An [ObservationExceptionHandler] may be registered with the
     * [Peripheral] to control which failures are propagated through (and terminate) the observation [Flow]. When
     * registered, only exceptions thrown from the [ObservationExceptionHandler] are propagated (and terminate) the
     * returned observation [Flow]. See [PeripheralBuilder.observationExceptionHandler] for more details.
     *
     * However, failures related to observations that occur during [connection][connect] are treated differently.
     * Instead of propagating through the [Flow] or the [ObservationExceptionHandler], the exception is thrown from
     * [connect] and the connection attempt fails, leaving this peripheral in the disconnected state.
     *
     * The optional [onSubscription] parameter is functionally identical to using the
     * [onSubscription][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.onSubscription] operator on the returned [Flow] except it has the
     * following special properties:
     *
     * - It will be executed whenever [connection][connect] is established (while the returned [Flow] is active); and
     * - It will be executed _after_ the observation is spun up (i.e. after enabling notifications or indications)
     *
     * The [onSubscription] action is useful in situations where an initial operation is needed when starting an
     * observation (such as writing a configuration to the peripheral and expecting the response to come back in the
     * form of a characteristic change). The [onSubscription] is invoked for every new subscriber; if it is desirable to
     * only invoke the [onSubscription] once per connection (for the specified [characteristic]) then you can either
     * use the [shareIn][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.shareIn] [Flow] operator on the returned [Flow], or call [observe]
     * again with the same [characteristic] and without specifying an [onSubscription] action.
     *
     * If multiple [observations][observe] are created for the same [characteristic] but with different [onSubscription]
     * actions, then the [onSubscription] actions will be executed in the order in which the returned [Flow]s are
     * subscribed to.
